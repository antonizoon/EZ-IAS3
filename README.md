# EZ-IAS3
A cross-platform upload script that makes it easy to upload data to the Internet Archive.

Most S3 uploaders for the Internet Archive suck big time. They don't have elegant support for multiple files, and others have trouble dealing with rate limits. 

This prevents people from uploading as much as they would like to it. We should create a simple, no holds-barred Curl/Bash or Python Requests version that will work on Windows or Linux.
